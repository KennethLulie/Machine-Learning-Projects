Tesla Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2017 Update
? Record Model-S and Model-X deliveries in Q4 2017
? Cash balance of $3.4B entering Q1 2018
? 2017 revenue of $11.8B, up 55% y-o-y from organic growth
? 2018 revenue growth expected to significantly exceed 2017 growth
? Continuing to target Model-3 production rate of 5,000/wk by Q2 end
2017 was an important year in Tesla’s history. Among other things, we started delivering Model-3 to customers, unveiled the Semi and
the next-generation Roadster, installed the world’s largest battery in Australia, and had record vehicle production and deliveries of
Model-S and Model-X. We also learned many lessons from the slower than planned production ramp of Model-3. All of this sets the
stage for 2018 to be a transformative year for us.
At some point in 2018, we expect to begin generating positive quarterly operating income on a sustained basis. With the planned ramp
of both Model-3 and our energy storage products, our rate of revenue growth this year is poised to significantly exceed last year’s
growth rate. The launch of Model-3 is what Tesla had been building towards from day one. We incorporated all the learnings from the
development and production of Roadster, Model-S, and Model-X to create the world’s first mass market electric vehicle that is priced on
par with its gasoline-powered equivalents – even without incentives. Now we are ramping up production significantly, and as we look
ahead in 2018, we are on the cusp of a step change in the world’s transition to sustainability.
ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT
We continue to target weekly Model-3 production rates of 2,500 by
the end of Q1 and 5,000 by the end of Q2. It is important to note
that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we
have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the
Model-3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately
forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.
What we can say with confidence is that we are taking many
actions to systematically address bottlenecks and add capacity in
places like the battery module line where we have experienced
constraints, and these actions should result in our production rate
significantly increasing during the rest of Q1 and through Q2.
Our goal is to become the best manufacturer in the automotive
industry, and having cutting edge robotic expertise in-house is at
the core of that goal. Our recent acquisitions of advanced
automation companies have added to our talent base and are
helping us increase Model-3 production rates more effectively. We
don’t want to simply replicate what we have built previously while
designing additional capacity. We want to continuously push the
boundaries of mass manufacturing.
As we shared previously, in order to incorporate our learnings and be capital efficient, we intend to start adding enough capacity to get
to a 10,000 unit weekly rate for Model-3 once we have first hit the 5,000 per week milestone.
Despite the delays that we experienced in our production ramp, Model-3 net reservations remained stable in Q4. In recent weeks, they
have continued to grow as Model-3 has arrived in select Tesla stores and received numerous positive reviews, including Automobile
Magazine’s 2018 Design of the Year award. We want to thank both our Model-3 suppliers and our customers, who have continued to
be such great partners and advocates, while patiently waiting as the ramp continues to accelerate.
In Q4, we delivered 28,425 Model-S and Model-X vehicles and 1,542 Model-3 vehicles, totaling 29,967 deliveries. Combined Model-S
and Model-X deliveries in Q4 grew 10% globally compared to our prior record in Q3, and they grew 28% compared to Q4 2016. As we
indicated heading into Q4, production of Model-S and Model-X during the quarter was limited to 22,137 vehicles due to reallocation of
some of the manufacturing resources to Model-3 production. This enabled us to reduce our finished-goods inventory to the lowest level
in about 18 months. 
Combined Model-S and Model-X net orders in Q4 were just shy of
Q3’s all-time high. Importantly, combined orders for Model-S and
Model-X grew significantly in 2017 compared to 2016. There had
initially been concerns about whether Model-3 would cannibalize
Model-S and Model-X. It seems the opposite is true. In stores
where Model-3 is on display, customer foot traffic has increased
considerably and orders for Model-S and Model-X have in fact
increased. There has been an even bigger increase in solar and
Powerwall sales.
The upcoming autonomous coast-to-coast drive will showcase a
major leap forward for our self-driving technology. Additionally, an
extensive overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software
has now been completed, which has enabled a step-change
improvement in the collection and analysis of data and
fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities. Our
neural net, which expands as our customer fleet grows, is able to
collect and analyze more high-quality data than ever before,
enabling us to rollout a series of new Autopilot features in 2018 and
beyond.
During Q4, we opened 12 new store and service locations resulting in 330 total locations worldwide at the end of the year. Service
capacity more than doubled in 2017, partially due to new locations, but also through a 50% increase in productivity of existing service
locations, as well as the significant expansion of our Mobile Service fleet, which now has 230 vehicles. We strive to create the best car
ownership experience on the planet, and a big part of that is through not requiring customers to come in to service their vehicle. In
North America alone, Mobile Service is now completing 30% of all service jobs, allowing those customers to never have to leave their
home or office to get their cars serviced. Not surprisingly, Mobile Service has achieved customer satisfaction that averages 98%. In
addition, the cost of servicing with our Mobile Service fleet is significantly lower than from our service centers. It now covers all of North
America and provides a level of convenience and a speed for scaling that is unique and unprecedented in the industry. In 2018, we will
continue to increase our service capacity with the goal of always remaining ahead of the Model-3 ramp.
Our Supercharger network has seen the most significant growth yet. In 2017, 338 new locations opened for a total of 1,128
Supercharger stations globally. Between Supercharger and Destination Charging, we increased capacity by over 90%. In preparation
for Model-3, we opened several large Supercharger stations along our most popular corridors, including between Los Angeles and San
Francisco and between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, both of which have a customer lounge, a café, a display of our energy products
and 40 charging stalls. With continued emphasis on convenient, reliable, and ubiquitous charging, 2018 will be another big year for
Tesla charging infrastructure.
The unveiling of Tesla Semi on November 16 launched Tesla into a
new product category that will have a transformative impact due to
a total cost of ownership that is superior to diesel trucks. Tesla
Semi combines a real-world range of up to 500 miles with
unprecedented performance while pulling a standard payload. Its
distinctive torque enables smooth acceleration to highway speed
even when fully loaded with cargo. Moreover, it has been
designed to dramatically improve safety not only for the driver and
cargo, but also for pedestrians and other cars on the road.
Tesla will be the first Semi customer. We plan to use the Tesla
Semi for our own logistics by transporting Model-3 components
from Gigafactory 1 to Fremont. Additionally, our initial fleet
customers who placed reservations for the Tesla Semi have been
helping us develop the best possible truck.
Also, after developing it in stealth with a very small team, we were
thrilled to surprise everyone with the next-generation Roadster.
Roadster was at the genesis of Tesla, a car that proved electric
vehicles can be fast, exciting and here to stay. The new Roadster
takes this concept to the next level. With 0-60 mph acceleration of
1.9 seconds and maximum speed of more than 250 mph, it will be
the fastest car in the world. When that performance is combined
with its 620 miles (1,000 km) of range, this supercar puts to rest
any debate about the limitations of electric vehicles.
 
ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
2018 will see major growth in Tesla energy storage deployments, as the production ramp of our storage products is just as steep as
with Model-3. This year, we aim to deploy at least three times the storage capacity we deployed in 2017.
On December 1, 2017, installation of the largest battery in the world was completed ahead of schedule in South Australia. This project
is already generating substantial benefit by meeting high summer demand when supply is limited and by instantaneously responding to
unplanned interruptions or frequency drops in the grid. Due to the success of this project, we're seeing an increase in demand for
Powerpack, our commercial energy storage product. With more electric utilities and governments around the world recognizing the
reliability, environmental, and economic benefits of this product, it’s clear that there is a huge opportunity for us in large scale energy
storage.
Powerwall demand for home energy storage remains exceptionally high, with orders consistently above production levels. We are
increasingly promoting our energy products in Tesla stores and in non-Tesla retail locations. There is a significant cross-selling
potential between Powerwall and our solar products, as evidenced by the fact that a vast majority of the customers who have ordered
Solar Roof have also ordered at least one Powerwall.
In Q4, we deployed 143 MWh of energy storage products, growing
45% from Q4 2016. Deployment of 129 MWh of energy storage in
South Australia will be recognized in Q1 2018 based on commercial
transfer of the site to the customer.
We also deployed 87 MW of energy generation systems in Q4,
which is 20% less than Q3 2017. Solar MW deployed declined as
volumes continue to be impacted by our decision to close certain
sales channels earlier this year and to focus on projects with better
margins. In addition, solar deployments were affected by the short
supply of Powerwalls for customers who wanted solar plus
Powerwall in their house. While volumes may continue to be
impacted by these factors over the near-term, we expect growth to
resume later this year.
We continue to ramp energy sales in Tesla retail stores and are
expanding our presence in partner locations. The mix of our
residential solar sales continues to shift towards cash and loan as
compared to leasing, reaching 54% of total residential solar sales in
Q4, up from 25% in Q4 2016. This has contributed to improved
cash performance of this business.
Initial production of Solar Roof at the Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo started in Q4, and we are ahead of schedule with the hiring targets we’ve
agreed to with the state of New York. As Solar Roof is truly the first-of-its-kind and there is significant complexity in both its
manufacturing and installation, we are deliberately ramping production at a gradual pace. When fully scaled, Gigafactory 2 will be able
to produce enough solar cells to add more than 150,000 new residential solar installations every year. As we ramp production, a
portion of the output will be dedicated for Solar Roof tiles with the balance used in our proprietary high-efficiency retrofit solar panels.
With demand outpacing production, we expect our backlog to remain in excess of one year for the next several quarters.
Q4 2017 RESULTS
Revenue & Gross Margin
 Three Months Ended Change
 December 31, September 30, December 31,
 2017 2017 2016 QoQ YoY
Automotive revenue ($000) $ 2,702,195 $ 2,362,889 $ 1,994,123 14 % 36 %
Automotive gross margin – GAAP 18.9 % 18.3 % 22.6 % 63 bp -364 bp
Automotive gross margin excluding SBC
 and ZEV credit – non-GAAP 13.8 % 18.7 % 22.2 % -490 bp -841 bp
? Automotive revenue in Q4 increased by 36% over Q4 2016, mainly due to 35% growth in vehicle deliveries. For 2017, Automotive
revenue was up 52% from 2016. ZEV credit sales in Q4 were $179 million as compared to $20 million in Q4 2016.
? Approximately 23% of Q4 deliveries were subject to lease accounting, which was slightly higher than in Q3. Last week, we closed
a $546 million asset backed securitization (ABS) of our Model-S and X lease portfolio, which was our first such offering. This
transaction and future ones like it will free up significant leasing capacity for long-term growth.
 
? GAAP Automotive gross margin improved slightly compared to Q3 to 18.9%. Non-GAAP Automotive gross margin declined to
13.8% in Q4, which was below our expectations. This is more than fully explained by the slower than expected ramp of Model-3.
Since Model-3 production was in the early stages of the ramp, allocation of full operating costs and depreciation made its gross
margin negative. We are expecting a negative Model-3 gross margin in Q1, while generating positive operating cash flows.
? Model-S and Model-X gross margin in Q4 declined very slightly compared to Q3. This was primarily due to significant reserves
booked for fixed assets that are no longer in service. We expect Model-S and Model-X gross margins to increase in 2018 with
improved trim mix and option content, lower cost of acquisition and lower manufacturing costs.
 Three Months Ended Change
 December 31, September 30, December 31,
 2017 2017 2016 QoQ YoY
Energy generation and storage revenue ($000) $ 298,037 $ 317,505 $ 131,385 -6 % 127 %
Energy generation and storage gross margin 5.5 % 25.3 % 2.7 % -1,979 bp 273 bp
? Energy generation and storage revenue in Q4 decreased by 6% compared to Q3. This was mainly driven by seasonal decline in
solar deployment and by our continued focus on more profitable, cash sales.
? GAAP gross margin in Q4 declined significantly as compared to Q3, due largely to several one-time factors and a higher mix of
storage products. Q4 gross margin was impacted by the typical seasonal decline in solar energy production and correspondingly
lower lease revenue in the winter months. We also booked one-time air freight costs for the South Australian battery project and
took write-downs related to legacy commercial & industrial projects that we had committed to prior to the acquisition of SolarCity.
? We expect gross margin to improve significantly in 2018 from higher operational and manufacturing cost efficiencies as well as
deployment of higher-quality commercial projects.
Other Highlights
? Service and Other revenue decreased by 5% compared to Q3 but increased by 81% compared to Q4 2016. Used car sales was
the main driver of this year-over-year growth.
? Service and Other gross loss increased to $89 million due to the significant growth of our service network in Q4 that has not been
fully utilized yet as the Model-3 production ramp works to catch up, reserves for settlements with former customers of Grohmann
and a one-time warranty true-up for used car sales. Gross margin on used cars sales was close to breakeven.
? Operating expenses increased by 5% sequentially to a total of $1.04 billion in spite of significant revenue growth. We continue to
focus on keeping tight control over operating expenses even as we ramp production.
? Basic shares outstanding at the end of Q4 were approximately 168 million.
Cash Flow and Liquidity
 Three Months Ended Change
 December 31, September 30, December 31,
($000) 2017 2017 2016 QoQ YoY
Cash flows from operating activities $ 509,891 $ (300,562 ) $ (448,209 ) 270 % 214 %
Collateralized lease borrowings 94,894 80,752 212,040 18 % -55 %
Operating cash flows plus collateralized lease borrowings $ 604,785 $ (219,810 ) $ (236,169 ) 375 % 356 %
? Cash flow from operating activities reached $510 million in Q4, achieving a new quarterly record. This was achieved mainly by
improved collection of receivables, inventory reduction of finished vehicles, improved working capital from the ramp of Model-3, and
growth in customer deposits. Cash flow from operating activities in 2017 was close to breakeven.
? The definition of operating cash flow includes cash outflow consumed by vehicle leasing. In order to show our cash flow from
operations before leasing activities, proceeds from collateralized lease borrowing need to be added back. When that is done, our
operating cash flow was $605 million in Q4. Additional $149 million of net funding was received in Q4 through our vehicle lease
warehouse line and tax equity fund to help our cash flows.
? Capital expenditures reached $787 million in Q4. The majority was attributable to Model-3 and Gigafactory 1 production capacity
increases. We are continuing to proactively manage capex spending. Additionally, some capex payments for Model-3 have been
deferred to Q1.
 
OUTLOOK
2018 will be a transformative year for Tesla, with a high level of operational scaling. As we ramp production of both Model-3 and our
energy products while keeping tight control of operating expenses, our quarterly operating income should turn sustainably positive at
some point in 2018.
We expect Model-S and Model-X deliveries to be approximately 100,000 in total, constrained by the supply of cells with the old 18650
form factor. As our sales network continues to expand to new markets in 2018, we believe orders should continue to grow. With
demand outpacing production, we plan to optimize the options mix in order to maximize gross margin. As stated above, we continue to
target a weekly Model-3 production rate of 2,500 by the end of Q1 and 5,000 by the end of Q2. Also, we are focused on achieving our
target of 25% gross margin for Model-3 after our production stabilizes at 5,000 cars per week.
We expect energy storage products to experience significant growth, with our aim to at least triple our sales this year. We expect
energy generation and storage gross margin to improve significantly in 2018 as we enter the year with a backlog of higher-margin
commercial solar projects and a more profitable energy storage business due to manufacturing efficiencies from scaling.
Service and Other gross margin should improve in each subsequent quarter in 2018. This will be achieved mainly through improved
service productivity via Mobile Service and better remote diagnostics for Model-3. Diagnostics architecture has been substantially
redesigned for Model-3 in order to reduce physical service visits by more than 50%. Additionally, Superchargers will start generating
revenue in 2018 with pay per use charging primarily by Model-3 customers.
Capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017. The majority of the spending will be to support increases in
production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and Fremont, and for building stores, service centers, and Superchargers.
This year, we are starting a new chapter of our journey. Hundreds of thousands of people will switch to our EVs and many others will
turn their houses into near self-sufficient energy generators. This is the year when we believe we can achieve true cost parity -
producing a premium EV like the Model-3 will be no more expensive than producing an ICE vehicle, something that many believe is not
yet possible. We’ll continue to work as hard as we can to bring sustainable energy generation, storage and consumption into the
mainstream.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our
consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss)
attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis, and
operating cash flows plus change in collateralized lease borrowing. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP
financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting
and financial planning purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s
historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management also believes that presentation
of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of
operations because it allows investors greater transparency to the information used by Tesla management in its financial and
operational decision-making so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that
Tesla management uses to run the business as well as allows investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP

Non-recourse debt $ 2,873,458 $ 2,375,782

(2) As of December 31, 2017, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of our convertible senior notes due in
 2018 (2018 Notes) issued in May 2013; therefore, the 2018 Notes were convertible at the holder’s option. As such, the carrying
 value of the 2018 Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value
 of the 2018 Notes was reflected as convertible debt in mezzanine equity, on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
 December 31, 2017.
